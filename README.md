## Customer Invoice Management System

This Project is a front and backend Customer Invoice Management System. The system has a fully functional Login system that allows the creation of both Customer and Administrator accounts. The Login system includes validation for Emails, Passwords and Phone numbers. The system also uses CRUD for all entities available. Administrators have access to management of all accounts on the system and can delete, update, or insert any available accounts or products. However, only Customers have the ability to create and manage Invoices within the system. 

All data in the system will be display on the dashboard after a user logs in. The dashboard will update as the system creates more products, adds more customers, or makes more sales. The system front end GUI is simple and user friendly. The main navigation is available from anywhere within the system, this allows users to traverse the system with ease. The Databases used for the backend of this system were Admin, Customer, Address, Invoice and Product. 

Data can be inserted into all of these table from within the system.
Each entity in the system is inserted to the database through the use of a front end form. Every form was built using Swing components such as Text fields and buttons. Each entity also has a GUI table to display all the entries that have been inserted. All entries can be updated and deleted from this table through the front end GUI.
